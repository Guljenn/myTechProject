    What do we need to create a method?
    1. A proper name
    2. Decide its accessibility level (public)
    3. Decide its accessibility way ( call it with class name or object
            static --> you want to call it with class name
            non-static --> call it with object name
     4. Decide if it returns or not
            what does it return
            if it doesn't return --> put void
      5. Does it take any argument
        if it takes, then decide what args it takes and how many args it takes

        NOTE: if your method is not void then use "return" key
        NOTE: if your method returns an int, then the variable used next to return keyword in the body must be an int
        NOTE: every method must have a body that runs a task
        NOTE: we can have multiple methods sharing the same name in the same class only if they have different args
                different args could be either the number of args or the types of args

        NOTE: DO NOT create a method inside another method
